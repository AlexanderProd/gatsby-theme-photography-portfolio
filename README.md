  Gatsby Theme Photography Portfolio
</h1>

This is a gatsby theme with big image grid and a minimalistic interface, the whole UI stays out of the way unless opened by hamburger menu. Perfect for keeping the focus on the images.

Every image has its own fullscreen page and all images of a category can be flipped through quickly. Thanks to `gatsby-plugin-sharp` and `gatsby-plugin-image` the load times are are also very short.

If you want to categorize your images just put them in different folders.

## ðŸš€ Installation

### For a new site

To quickly create a new Gatsby page with the `gatsb-theme-photography-portfolio` you can use my [starter](https://github.com/AlexanderProd/gatsby-starter-photography-portfolio).

```shell
npx gatsby new gatsby-photography-portfolio https://github.com/AlexanderProd/gatsby-starter-photography-portfolio
```

### For an existing site

If you already have a site youâ€™d like to add the blog theme to, you can manually configure it.

1.  Install the photography portfolio theme

    ```shell
    npm install gatsby-theme-photography-portfolio
    ```

2.  Add the configuration to your gatsby-config.js file

    ```JS
    // gatsby-config.js
    module.exports = {
      plugins: [
        {
          resolve: `gatsby-theme-photography-portfolio`,
          options: {
            // basePath defaults to `/`
            basePath: `/portfolio`,
          },
        },
      ],
    }
    ```

3.  Add images

    Add images to your site by adding them to `images` directory in the root of your site. You can create categories by putting the images in subfolders.
